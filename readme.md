## **What is Move it ?**
This project is based on the Pomodoro technique, developed in 1988 by the Italian Francisco Cirillo, it's a method of time management that can be applied to different tasks, whether in studies or at work.
The Pomodoro method is simple and lasts two hours. First, you perform an activity for 25 minutes. When the time is up, rest for 5 minutes. So on until you complete two hours. As a reward, you rest another 30 minutes.

Pomodoro was applied in a gamification model, in which at each pause of tasks, there is a task at the moment of rest. After completing this task, the user gains experience, being able to level up.
